# Agentpolis Demo Application

This repository demonstrates how can be Agentpolis used to simulate urban transportation scenarios. First, we illustrate how to convert raw OpenStreetMap data to geoJSON format used by Agentpolis in Python. Then, create a simple Java application that simulates and visualizes movement of several vehicles over the road network specified in the input geoJSON files. 

### Example of usage

To run an example simulation scenario, follow [getting started instructions on wiki](https://github.com/aicenter/agentpolis-demo/wiki).
