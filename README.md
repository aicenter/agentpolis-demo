# Agentpolis Demo Application

This repository contains an example simulation scenario that demonstrates how can be Agentpolis used to simulate urban transportation scenarios. First, we demonstrate how to convert raw openstreetmap data, preprocess them, and convert them to geojson in Python. Then, create a simple Java application that simulates and visualizes movement of several vehicles over the road network spcified in the input geojson files. 

### Example of usage

To run an example simulation scenario, follow [getting started instructions on wiki](https://github.com/aicenter/agentpolis-demo/wiki).
